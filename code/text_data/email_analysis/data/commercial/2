Look, a Woot Newsletter. You're thrilled, I'm sure.

   Oh, hey, ann9enigma.

   Hi. Yeah, so it's late January. And Woot's up to all kinds of fun stuff=
, or
   whatever. It's just one barrel of monkeys after another around here lat=
ely.
   What? No, we're not crying. Look, do you mind if we just get this newsl=
etter
   thing over with quick so we can just go back to bed? These microwave
   mozzarella sticks aren't gonna eat themselves.

   _[1]Woot Minions: The Affiliate Advertising Program That Will Save Ame=
rica_
   Some call it an affiliate program. We call it a way to make our fans do=
 the
   dirty work of attracting new members without us having to pay to play i=
n
   Madison Avenue's leagues. We also call it [2]Woot Minions, so you can'=
t say
   we didn't warn you. Sign up now, if you have no better way to squander=
 your
   brief time on this planet.

   _[5]Consumer Electronics Shame: Woot=E2=80=99s CES Videos_
   Every January, the Woot blog orders the unluckiest of our writers to ma=
ke
   the long desert march to Las Vegas to cover the [6]Consumer Electronic=
s
   Show. Their video reports from the convention killing floor bear witnes=
s
   that the biggest suckers aren't necessarily weeping at the blackjack ta=
ble.
   If you've only got time to watch one, the [7]Wootable Awards video con=

   _[8]They=E2=80=99re Doin=E2=80=99 It From Poll To Poll_
   If there's anything Americans want more of, it's nosy strangers pesteri=
ng
   them for details of their personal business. So it's no wonder our new=
 daily
   polls on the front page of [9]Kids.Woot and [10]Wine.Woot are such
   blockbuster sensations. Come explore such burning questions of the day=
 as
   "Mad Dog vs. Strawberry Hill" and "Which Hanna-Barbera character wears=
 the
   coolest scarf?" At last=E2=80=94a place on the Internet where you can e=

   _[11]Cheapest In Show: Deals.Woot Feted, Appreciated, Celebrated_
   Thanks to the contributions of our vast community of cheapskates,
   [12]Deals.Woot used to be the mega-raddest place on the Internet to fi=
nd
   deals. Now it's the award-winning mega-raddest place on the Internet to=
 find
   deals. Deals.Woot snared the Affiliate of the Year award at the Affilia=
te
   Summit West 2011, held in Las Vegas earlier this month. Pound your ches=

   So, listen, this is really taking a lot out of us. We're gonna go lay d=
own
   and try not to think about all the work we have to do because when we l=
et
   ourselves think about it, it's just overwhelming. Totally overwhelming.
   What? No. We told you already, we're not crying.
