=0D=0ADear ann9enigma,=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0AWelcome to the warm embrace=
 of Woot, the first, best, and most hygienic daily deal site! Sit still=
 a <br />=0D=0Aminute because you need to know this stuff:=0D=0A=0D=0A<ul>=
=0D=0A<li>=0D=0AYou're now a registered member of all four of our sites:=
 woot.com, shirt.woot.com, <br />=0D=0Awine.woot.com and sellout.woot.com.=
 Don't be alarmed. We'll explain more <br />=0D=0Alater.=0D=0A</li>=0D=0A<li>=
=0D=0ATypical orders take up to 5 business days to ship from our warehouse=
 (except for overnight <br />=0D=0At-shirt orders, which go out sooner,=
 and wine orders, which take longer).  If you order an item <br />=0D=0Aduring=
 peak times like a Woot-Off, it can take a little longer.  Once we ship=
 it, delivery time to <br />=0D=0Ayour door depends on FedEx or SmartPost.=
=0D=0A</li>=0D=0A<li>=0D=0AOnce the item ships out, you can access your=
 tracking data by going to Your Account and<br />=0D=0Aclicking on the order=
 number. If you have a problem receiving your order, or you receive the=
 <br />=0D=0Awrong item, contact <a href=3D"service@woot.com">service@woot.com</a>.=
=0D=0A</li>=0D=0A<li>=0D=0AIf you receive your item and it doesn't work,=
 contact the manufacturer first. They made the junk. <br />=0D=0ALet them=
 deal with it. If they turn out to be total tools, contact <a href=3D"service@woot.com">service@woot.com</a>=
 and we'll <br />=0D=0Agrudgingly provide some further assistance.=0D=0A</li>=
=0D=0A<li>=0D=0AIf you receive your item and decide you don't like it, take=
 it to eBay or pawn it off on one of <br />=0D=0Ayour so-called friends.=
 We don't want it, either.=0D=0A</li>=0D=0A</ul>=0D=0A=0D=0AThat goes for=
 Woot.com and all of the sites in the Woot.com family. There's some specific=
 stuff <br />=0D=0Ayou might want to know about each of the others. And=
 here it comes now.=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0AShirt.woot - Check the size chart,=
 check the size chart, check the size chart. It's at the bottom of the <br=
 />=0D=0Aproduct description for each sale. If you order the wrong size,=
 we won't take it back - your only option <br />=0D=0Ais to gain or lose=
 weight so it fits, possibly including painful, costly cosmetic surgery.=
 If you want your <br />=0D=0Aovernight order the next day, place it by=
 noon Central time. International orders generally take about 3-<br />=0D=0A4=
 weeks to arrive. Looking for an old shirt design? If you're lucky, it'll=
 still be for sale via our<br />=0D=0AReckoning page. If you're somewhat=
 less lucky, it might turn up as one of our weekly Shirt.Woot <br />=0D=0AClassics.=
 If you think your one-year-old can design a better shirt, encourage your=
 <br />=0D=0Aone-year-old to enter the Derby, our weekly design competition.=
 That $1,000 prize can buy a lot of <br />=0D=0ABinkies.<br />=0D=0A<a href=3D"http://shirt.woot.com/derby/">http://shirt.woot.com/derby/</a><br=

 />=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0AWine.woot - First, don't get your hopes up: wine=
 orders can only be shipped to certain states, so read <br />=0D=0Athe entire=
 list of eligible states before you print up the invitations to your wine=
 party and place your <br />=0D=0Aorder. Ineligible orders will be cancelled=
 and refunded. If you do complete your order and receive the <br />=0D=0Atracking=
 data, make sure you give it some time to update. It won't be uncommon for=
 it to take a little <br />=0D=0Awhile for real, actual data to show up.=
 You might call the data "late" - we prefer to think of it as "aged".<br=

=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0ASellout.woot - Don't be confused or disoriented=
 by the redirect when you visit the site - we just have to <br />=0D=0Arun=
 you through Yahoo! Shopping before you come back to Woot turf. It's perfectly=
 normal. You should <br />=0D=0Aknow that we actually sell things here at=
 times that could partner nicely with items from the regular <br />=0D=0AWoot=
 website, giving you a chance to have your cake and eat it, and then take=
 a bite of another guy's <br />=0D=0Acake when he's not looking, and mmmm...cake...is=
 this email almost over? We're getting hungry.<br /> =0D=0A<a href=3D"http://sellout.woot.com/WhatIsWoot.aspx">http://sellout.woot.com/WhatIsWoot.aspx</a>=
=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0AKids.woot - Keep in mind that Kids.Woot is a site=
 that sells childrens' products, not necessarily a place <br />=0D=0Ayou'd=
 want your kids hanging out. We make every effort to monitor the content=
 and activity in our <br />=0D=0Amessage boards, but you should approach=
 Kids.Woot with the same circumspection you'd bring to any <br />=0D=0Aother=
 adult-oriented site. Well, not "adult-oriented" in the nasty sense. We=
 just mean it's for mature <br />=0D=0Aaudiences only. But not "mature"=
 as in- ah, forget it, you know what we mean.<br />=0D=0A<a href=3D"http://kids.woot.com/WhatIsWoot.aspx">http://kids.woot.com/WhatIsWoot.aspx</a>=
=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0ABear with us a moment more and we can all get on=
 with our lives. If you email <a href=3D"service@woot.com">service@woot.com</a>,=
 <br />=0D=0A<b><u>make sure you include your order number and/or username</u></b>.=
 We'd hate to have to track you down <br />=0D=0Athrough other, less savory=
 means. And this last bit of information is critical: when you look at your=
 <br />=0D=0Aorder history and panic because you don't see an order you=
 placed, make sure you are logged into the <br />=0D=0AWoot site you purchased=
 it from. Your Wine.Woot orders won't show up in your order history if you're=
 <br />=0D=0Alooking at it on Shirt.Woot, and so on. And you'll be upset,=
 and we'll be upset, and we'll each say things <br />=0D=0Awe don't mean,=
 and even though we'll eventually work it all out, things will never be=
 the same between <br />=0D=0Aus again.=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0ALast but=
 certainly not least, happy Wooting!=0D=0A<br /><br />=0D=0AWoot Member=
