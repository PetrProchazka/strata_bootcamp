today the weirdest thing happened to me.

I had lunch with that girl
about my age, but possibly
younger.
Very interesting person, very nice too
but then she said something that rang a bell
how could she know this and that
I asked a question and was surprised by the answer,
then the asked me something equally weird
and
we realized that we are cousins.
our parents are not very good at PR so
we only met once 20 years ago.
and possibly once before that.
or maybe not.
we are both data people and
we live a few blocks from each other so
let's hope we can be good friends.
